👋 Hi, I’m @0xDev69

🔥 Passionate blockchain developer with a flair for creating decentralized solutions.

🛠 I've created this new GitHub page to showcase our BitCoders.Org services, as well as to share some of my previous works.

👨‍💻 From smart contracts to dApps, and from ICO/IDO platforms to custom SWAP DEX projects, I’ve been involved in a variety of 
blockchain ventures both as a Developer and Project Manager and everything inbetween.

🌍 Born in South Africa, now thriving in the UK, and into the world of crypto since 2016.

🤝 Feel free to reach out for collaborations, consulting, or just a crypto chat!
